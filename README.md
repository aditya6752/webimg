GSoC 2016 Project on Web Image Analysis

Objective:
The main task of this project is to develop a web API for Image analysis for algorithms like Image segmentation, Edge detection etc. to make these transformation easier. With the development of new web platform “Webassemly” which will serve as a new language as well as a compile target to transform c/c++ to low level binary format, this task could be made much easier.  We tried to experiment how it can be done and evaluate the performance of the three web languages namely, JS, Asm.js and Webassembly. The final product of this experiment would be a web page with three paths to analyze the image (Via. js, Asm.js and webassembly) and give you the fastest of them.
